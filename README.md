# Tywragriculture

Tywragriculture is a mod aimed to build onto Minecraft's farming vibe, adding new crops, dishes, drinks and so much more to see!
-
As well as adding our own content, we provide an API for people wanting to make addons on the mod!

This will get Farmer's Delight Compat later, as that will probably stay the main focus farming mod, and this mod adds a lot of similar mechanics, crops and items.

> [!NOTE]
This mod is very similar to Farmer's Delight. And I am aware of that. It is NOT an exact copy.
It also aims to add extra original features not present in FD.
